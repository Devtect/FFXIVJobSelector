# ⚔️FINAL FANTASY XIV JOB SELECTOR⚔️

Simple FFXIV job selector for people who are undecisive like myself. The program lets you select roles and gives you a random job within that role. It also saves the previously selected jobs.

## 💽Installation💽

Download and run the .exe file. (~~no virus i promise~~ it was a false positive, fixed it with compiling bootload for pyinstaller)

## 👨‍💻Usage👨‍💻

Click on the roles you would like to play and the program will give you a random job within that role. Click on All Jobs to see all jobs you have randomly given.

## 👍Contributing👍

Feel free to pull, clone and have fun with the code.
